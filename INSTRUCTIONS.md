# Instructions for Formatting your Thesis or Dissertation for Submission to the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics

REVISIONS WERE MADE TO THIS DOCUMENT IN APRIL 2015

A Master's or Ph.D. student who is prepared to submit a thesis or dissertation
to the university should receive approval from the College of Natural Sciences
and Mathematics. Your thesis or dissertation (also referred to as the
"manuscript") should be submitted to the Dean's Office only after you and your
committee members have carefully reviewed it to ensure that it is in complete
compliance with the requirements stated in this document. _Remember, your
manuscript will be at some point publically available via the Texas Digital
Library. Therefore, make sure that the product reflects well on you, your
advisor and committee, and this university. Treat it as though it becomes a
part of your resume on which your future depends._

Please consult the document called “Procedures for Submission of Theses and
Dissertations” for information on the submission process to the College and to
the Texas Digital Library.

## ORDER OF PAGES

The manuscript _must_ include the following required items _in the order listed_;
no other order is acceptable. Only items in italics are optional.

_Examples of the following pages are given at the end of this document_. For
items 2, 3, and 5 below, the format must be as shown in the examples.

1. **_Only for bound copies_**: A blank sheet of paper should be at the beginning (no
   page number shown and no page number assigned)

2. **Title Page** - Must show the month and year of your graduation. Only three
   months are acceptable: **December** for Fall graduation, **May** for Spring
   graduation, or **August** for Summer graduation. (Be sure and follow the
   format in sample 1 - no page number should be printed, but page i is assigned.)

3. **Signature Page** - At least _one original_ must have the _original
   signatures_ of the committee, the student, and the Dean of the College,
   preferentially in black ink. (Follow the format in sample 2 – note page ii
   is printed)

4. ***Acknowledgements, Preface, or Foreword*** [ _Optional_ (Sample 3)]

5. **Abstract Title Page** - Must show the month and year of commencement for
   your graduation.  Only three months are acceptable: **December** for Fall
   graduation, **May** for Spring graduation, or **August** for Summer graduation.
   (Follow the format in sample 4)

6. **Abstract** – There should be only **one** abstract that summarizes the
   whole thesis/dissertation. The abstract must be double spaced and no longer
   than _350 words_ (Sample 5). There should not be additional abstracts at the
   beginning of individual chapters.

7. **Table of Contents** – May be single spaced. All entries should match
   exactly the corresponding headings and subheadings in the manuscript. The
   page number listed for each entry must be correct. (Sample 6)


8. ***Lists (Figures, Tables, Schemes, Acronyms, Abbreviations, etc.)*** -
   Optional. Be consistent in your format. Page numbers must be included for
   lists of figures and tables; otherwise, they are of no benefit to the
   reader. Note: all figures, tables, etc. must be incorporated in the text,
   and not put at the end of the manuscript.

9. **Text of Manuscript** – Must be double spaced. The first page of the text
   should show the lower- case Arabic numeral 1. The manuscript's format must
   be consistent throughout the complete work.

10. ***Appendices*** – Supplemental information (e.g. extensive data tables,
    detailed methods, ancillary proofs) may be placed either before or after
    the references.

11. **References or Bibliography** – May be single spaced. Be consistent in
    your bibliographic format. Putting references at the end of the
    thesis/dissertation is preferred; however you may put references at the end
    of each section/chapter as an alternative.

12. **_Only for bound copies_** – A blank sheet of paper should be at the end of each
    copy submitted.


## MARGINS

The following minimum margins are required:

  - **Left**: 1.5 inch
  - **Right**: 1 inch
  - **Top**: 1 inch
  - **Bottom**: 1 inch to the base of the page numbers. The text must be at least
                  1.25 inch from the bottom edge of the page.

All text, captions, and figures (including charts, graphs, maps, tables, and photographs) _must be
inside these margins. There are no exceptions._

**Theses and dissertations with incorrect margins will be immediately rejected by NSM and will
have to be resubmitted.**


## TITLING YOUR THESIS OR DISSERTATION

Your manuscript will be a valuable source for other scholars only if it can be
located easily. Retrieval systems use the words in the title (and sometimes a
few other descriptive words) to locate your manuscript. It is essential that
the title be a meaningful description of the content of your research.


## PREPARING THE ABSTRACT

An abstract should be a short version of the thesis or dissertation. All NSM
theses and dissertations must have an abstract that contains no more than 350
words. It should contain the following: (1) statement of the problem, (2)
procedures and methods, (3) results, and (4) conclusions But, the abstract
should include only the most important things that can fit into these 350
words. That usually means talking more about the conclusions than the methods.
A brief introduction of the problem may be necessary but it is important to get
to the conclusions in short order. An abstract is not an advertisement or
tease. As such, it should not have statements such as, “this work made several
measurements, which allowed the formation of some important conclusions.” A
sentence like that does no telling; the reader should not have to go elsewhere
in the thesis to learn what measurements were made and what conclusions were
formed. Statements about the work that is being abstracted should be clear and
contain as much detail and precision as can be fit into 350 words. Landes
(1951, Am.  Assoc. Petrol. Geol. Bull., v.50, no. 9, page 1992) provides an
excellent discussion of what should and should not be in a scientific abstract.

Mathematical formulas, diagrams, and other illustrative materials should not be
included in the abstract. An abstract should be double-spaced and printed on
one side of the paper only.

## TEXT OF THE THESIS OR DISSERTATION

### Previously published content

If you have previously published parts of your thesis or dissertation in
scientific articles, you must indicate this in your document and give the
reference(s). For example, you may cite your paper(s) on the front page of the
relevant chapter(s) or at the beginning of the relevant section(s).

### Style

A standard guideline is to prepare your manuscript following accepted
requirements by any one of the leading American journals in your field, and
apply that format consistently throughout the thesis or dissertation. Do not
change formats between chapters or sections! Your advisor and research
committee should help you arrive at an acceptable presentation.

### Spacing

The abstract, acknowledgments, and main body of the manuscript must be
double- spaced. The captions must be single spaced. The table of contents and
the references may be single-spaced. If individual references are single
spaced, you should double space between references.

### Font

Make sure that the font size is legible. We recommend that you use the following typefaces used
by NSF for formatting grant proposals, which are:

  - Arial, Courier New, or Palatino Linotype at a font size of 10 points or larger;
  - Times New Roman at a font size of 11 points of larger; or
  - Computer Modern family of fonts at a font size of 11 points or larger.

### Headings

Decide how you wish to structure your manuscript and be consistent throughout
it. For example, if you use **BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS** for major headings,
CAPITAL LETTERS for subheadings, and Normal Type for Sub-subheadings, _be
consistent_ throughout the manuscript. If you change font type or size for
different headings, be consistent. Make certain that your table of contents
agrees with the manuscript concerning page numbers and _exact titles_ of
headings.

Avoid sections that begin on the last line of a page or sections that end on
the first line of a page.

### Grammar

Edit your manuscript for proper English sentence structure, grammatical
correctness, correct punctuation, spelling, and consistency. Consistency here
means the following. If you hyphenate a word, join two words to make a new
word, italicize a foreign word, or otherwise use language peculiar to your
discipline, be consistent throughout the manuscript. Use a Spell Checker but do
not rely solely on it. There is no substitute for careful editing. Have a
colleague read your manuscript for clarity and correctness. Manuscripts with a
large number of errors in the first few pages will be returned without further
reading. _Remember_ — your thesis or dissertation will become part of the public
domain. _Make sure that the product reflects well on you, your department, your
advisor and committee, and this university. Treat it as though it becomes part
of your resume on which your future depends._

### Charts, Graphs, Tables, Photographs, Figures, and Captions

All figures, charts, tables, graphs, and tables must fit within the prescribed
margins, and should be placed within the body of the manuscript and _not at the
end_. If they are in color, they must be submitted as such to NSM, and not as
black and white copies.

### Captions

Captions should be single-spaced and complete enough to be self-contained (i.e.
the reader should not have to go into the main text to understand the figure).
If it is necessary to place a caption on a separate page to meet the margin
requirements, turn the caption to face the figure and reverse the margins on
the caption. By presenting the figure and caption this way, the reader sees
both at the same time. If the figure or caption is in landscape mode (rather
than portrait), the bottom should be on the right (outside) edge of the page;
however the margins remain the same and the page number remains at the bottom,
as with all other pages.

### Numbering

The style of numbering figures and tables should be consistent throughout the
manuscript. Numbers can be consecutively numbered from beginning to end of the
manuscript, or by chapter. If by chapter, however, there can be no duplicated
figure numbers in the manuscript. For example, figure 1.1 can be for first
figure in first chapter, figure 2.1 for first figure in chapter 2, etc. A
similar numbering format should be used for tables. Figures in _appendices_
should also have captions and numbers (e.g. figure A.1, A.2, or A1.1, A2.1)

### Lettering and Labels

Graphs should have axis labels, including units. Scale bars should be provided,
as appropriate. Maps should have scales and a north arrow. All lettering must
be legible: letters should be at least 1 mm tall in the printed form. Be aware
that figures obtained from other sources or screen shots may have been reduced
such that the lettering is no longer legible. In this case, the lettering
should be eliminated or the figure relabeled.

### Source

If a figure or diagram is obtained from another source, that source must be
cited in the caption and appear in the reference list.

### Oversize Pages

Occasionally, charts, tables, maps, graphs, photographs, or figures that are
larger than the standard page might have to be used in your
thesis/dissertation. If so, they should be saved as a separate document for
uploading. If you are binding copies of your thesis or dissertation, then the
preferred method is to place the oversize pages in a pocket in the back of
the document after it is bound.  You may also have a fold-out page within the
text; however remember to leave a space for binding when folded.


## NUMBERING THE PAGES

Each page in the manuscript, beginning with the title page, must be assigned a
number. Do not write the word “page” in front of the number. The following plan
of page numbering is required:

1. Use lower case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, etc.) for the preliminaries
   (Title Page through Table of Contents, List of Figures, and List of Tables,
   if included), The title page is assigned page number i, but the number is not
   shown on the page. The printed numbering begins with ii on the signature page.
   All page numerals must be placed at the center bottom, with a one-inch margin
   measured from the bottom of the page number.

2. Use lower case Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) for the remainder of the
   manuscript, including the text, illustrations, appendices, and bibliography.
   Each page must be numbered consecutively. Avoid the use of letter suffixes,
   such as 10a or 10b. The numbering begins with page 1 on the first page of the
   text and runs consecutively to the end of the manuscript. All page numbers are
   placed at the center bottom, with a one-inch margin to the bottom of the page
   number.

3. If the description of an illustration or a caption for a figure is too long
   to be placed on the same page, it should be placed on the previous page. If
   you are binding your thesis or dissertation, make sure to turn the page such
   that the description is facing and is the same orientation as the figure or
   illustration. _Remember that facing pages must be numbered and have the margins
   reversed. Do not print any page double sided._

4. When binding a manuscript, one volume cannot contain more than 400 pages. If
   your manuscript exceeds 400 pages, you should choose a suitable place to
   separate it into multiple volumes. Each volume should contain a title page
   duplicating the title page of the first volume. You should identify
   them further as Volume I, II, etc. In any case, the page numbering may
   follow consecutively from one volume to another, or begin with Arabic number
   1 at each new title page.


## STYLE, REFERENCES, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY

As a rule, the format and style of presentation should conform to acceptable
standards of scientific and scholarly writing in the discipline. At the
minimum, the following information should be given:

   - For journal articles: author(s), title of the journal, volume number,
     inclusive pages, year of publication;
   - For books: author(s) or editor(s), title of the book, publisher, year of
     publication;
   - For articles or chapter in book, authors of article, editors and title of
     book, publisher, year of publication;
   - For conference proceedings: author(s), title of proceedings (may include
     location), volume number and inclusive pages (if available), and date of
     publication,

For the instance in which these rules are an inadequate guide, consult a recent
edition of *The Chicago Manual of Style*, University of Chicago Press or *A Manual
for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations* (7th edition) by Kate L.
Turabian, University of Chicago Press. The latter is an abbreviated version of
The Chicago Manual of Style. You may purchase it from the University of Houston
Bookstore. *A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations* is
the guide the college thesis and dissertation reader uses to resolve questions
of grammar, punctuation, and usage.

You may choose headline or sentence style for titles in the references, but _be
consistent in your style_.  In headline style titles, all first letters are
capitalized except for articles (a, an, and the) and prepositions of fewer than
five letters. Prepositions with five or more letters may be capitalized. With
hyphenated words, generally only the first word is hyphenated. In sentence
style titles, only the first word of the title and proper nouns are
capitalized. If journal abbreviations are used, make sure to use the same
abbreviations consistently every time the journal name appears in the reference
list.

Be sure and check that all references cited in the text are in the
bibliography, and all references in the bibliography are cited in the text.


## AVOIDING COMMON ERRORS

The page numbers given in the items below refer to *A Manual for Writers of
Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations* (7th edition) by Kate L. Turabian,
University of Chicago Press.

   - In a series consisting of three or more words, phrases, or clauses,
     separate the elements with commas.

     > _Example_ : The elements included hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon. (See
     > p.298, section 21.2.2, regarding commas in a series.)

   - In headline-style capitalization (often used in titles, table of contents,
     and bibliographies), do not capitalize the second part (or subsequent
     parts) of a hyphenated compound unless it is a proper noun or adjective.

     > _Examples_: Self-regulated Genes; Genes that are Self Regulated; A
     > Twenty-first-century History of Science; Helmholtz-Gibbs Equation (See p.314,
     > section 22.3.1, for rules headline-style capitalization.)

   - Use a semicolon between the clauses of compound sentences that are joined
     by conjunctive adverbs such as *therefore*, *hence*, *however*, *nevertheless*,
     *accordingly*, *thus*, and *then*. The semicolon precedes the adverb, and a
     comma usually follows it.

     > _Example_: The temperature was much lower than we anticipated;
     > therefore, we did not go outside to work. (See p.301, section 21.3,
     > for uses of the semicolon.)


   - A comma should follow the words *namely*, *that is*, *for example*, *i.e.*, and *e.g*. There must
     also be a punctuation mark before each of these expressions, but the kind depends on the
     nature and complexity of the sentence.

     > _Examples_:
     >
     >  a. The farmer brought several kinds of animals, namely, pigs, horses,
     >     and cows, into the classroom.
     >  b. The temperature in some areas of the world normally exceeds 100 F; for
     >     example, the average daytime temperature in Death Valley is 102 F.
     >     (See p. 300, section 21.2.4, for uses of the comma.)

   - A verb should agree with its subject in person and number.

     > _Example_: The employer of engineers and scientists has to be careful
     > about hiring practices. ( The word employer is a singular subject and
     > requires the singular verb has. Do not confuse the subject with one of
     > its modifiers.)

   - A reference using *et al.* is correctly written as Brady *et al.*, not
     Brady, *et al.* or Brady *et. al.*

   - If you punctuate mathematical or chemical equations (e.g. follow with a
     comma or period), punctuate them all and do it correctly. If equations are
     numbered, do so consistently.

   - The word *data* is plural and requires a plural verb.

     > Example: The data _were_ inconclusive.

   - An item in the list of figures need not contain the full figure caption,
     but the portion that is included should be accurate and representative of
     the content.

   - If you hyphenate a word, be consistent throughout the manuscript.

   - Do not confuse *whose* with *who's* or *its* with *it's*.

   - The word *respectively* is set off with commas, or with a comma and a
     period, if it comes at the end of a sentence.

   - On the signature page, the title of the college is Natural Sciences and Mathematics, not
     Natural Science and Mathematics.

                                     **ABSTRACT**

 *Staphylococcus aureas* Cowan 1 strain (SAC) contains a cell wall protein that has an affinity for

 immune complexes and the IgG of most mammalian species. Dogs with spontaneous mammary

 adenocarcinoma whose plasma was perfused over immobilized SAC developed a potent, apparently

 humorally mediated tumoricidal response within hours after the perfusion. This response was

 accompanied by changes in the humoral concentrations of immune complexes, IgG, and tumor-

 specific antibodies. SAC efficiently removed the complexes from the plasma during the first 5-6

 minutes of the perfusion, but as the perfusion continued, the concentration of complexes in the

 plasma immediately leaving the SAC filter equaled or exceeded the pre- perfusion values.

 Following the perfusion, the in vivo quantities of circulating immune complexes were elevated, the

 total serum IgG concentrations were depressed temporarily but rapidly rebounded to greater than

 pre-perfusion   values,   and   the   levels   of tumor-specific   antibodies became increased and

 remained elevated for varying periods of time. For these studies, a solid phase of Clq binding

 assay was shown to be reliable and reproducible in the quantification of canine immune

 complexes. This assay may also be useful in the identification of dogs with tumors that are

 amenable to the extra corporeal SAC perfusion treatment.
